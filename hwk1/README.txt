Programming #1: 
There are four classes for this question (Rectangle, CompareArea, ComparePerimeter, and the main class, Problem1. 
This program uses implemented Comparators to compare the sizes of rectangles and determine which is larger based on area and perimeter.
The method findMax() finds the largest of several Rectangles based on a certain comparator. It returns the index of the larger Rectangle.
Within the main tester method, several Rectangle objects are created and are put into an array of Rectangles. These are then compared using findMax().  

Programming #2: 
There are two classes for this question (CheckTime and TimeInterval).
This program uses a timer to determine how long it takes to run different algorithms. 
A timer is created and a user inputs a value, long n, which dictates how many values each algorithm must cycle through to produce a sum.  
Code for each part of the question was commented out as it was completed.

Programming #3: 
This program uses an overloaded binarySearch() method to recursively search an array given by a command-line entered text file for a user-inputted value. 
There are two binarySearch() methods. The first method is the driver method for the binary recursive search. It returns an int and takes two parameters: 
an array of integers and an int x that is being searched for. The second method is the recursive method for the binary recursive search. So long as the 
value has not been found and the base case has not been reached, it will continue the binary search for int x. It returns either -1 if x is not found, or 
the index of x if it is in the array.
