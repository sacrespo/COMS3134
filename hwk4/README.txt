Programming #1: An application that takes in a text file and builds a Huffman Tree 
and code from it. A GUI is produced that allows users to enter text to encode and 
decode based off of the code generated from the original text file. An edited version 
of Weiss's binary heap code is used for a priority queue. The blueprint for a HuffmanTree 
object takes in files, or Strings and converts them into a series of 0s and 1s based
on the frequency of each symbol appearing. The code for the creation of the graphical 
portion of the GUI can be found in the HuffmanTree class as well as the graph needed 
to access HuffmanTree variables.
